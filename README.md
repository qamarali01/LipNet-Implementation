LipNet Implementation

	I hope you’re starting this project with a smile! If not, here’s one for you:

Why did the scarecrow win an award?
Because he was outstanding in his field!

This project implements the LipNet research paper to create a lip-reading system that interprets spoken words from video sequences. The model uses 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (Conv3D) and Bidirectional LSTMs for spatiotemporal feature extraction and sequence learning, achieving high accuracy on the LipNet dataset. The system decodes lip movements into text and has potential applications in assistive technologies.

Features

	•	Accurate Lip-Reading: Decodes spoken words from video sequences by analyzing lip movements.
	•	State-of-the-Art Architecture: Implements the LipNet model with Conv3D for spatial and temporal feature extraction.
	•	Efficient Training: Utilizes the LipNet dataset with robust preprocessing and augmentation.

Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
	•	Python 3.x
	•	TensorFlow
	•	Keras
	•	OpenCV
	•	NumPy
	•	Matplotlib
	•	Imageio
	•	Jupyter Notebook (optional for experimentation)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy matplotlib imageio

Model Architecture

The model combines:
	1.	Conv3D Layers: Extract spatiotemporal features from video frames.
	2.	Bidirectional LSTMs: Learn temporal dependencies for accurate sequence decoding.
	3.	CTC Loss: Aligns video frame sequences with text labels, enabling robust training for unsegmented data.

Usage

1. Preprocessing and Training

	•	The LipNet dataset is preprocessed by normalizing video frames, extracting regions of interest (lip movements), and applying augmentation.
	•	The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset using the provided training script.

2. Testing and Inference

	•	The model can be tested on unseen samples to decode lip movements into text.
	•	Predictions and corresponding ground truth sequences are displayed for evaluation.


Output

The model outputs decoded text sequences from video samples. Testing has shown high accuracy on the LipNet dataset, with clear alignment between lip movements and text predictions.
